## Monitor Cumulocity microservices using Built.io

Third-party services can be employed to monitor microservices deployed in Cumulocity IoT. One cool tool to achieve such goal is [Built.io](https://www.built.io/).

This is a small workflow to monitor the health endpoint of a microservice deployed in the Cumulocity IoT platform. If the microservice is not up and running, Built.io will notify a Slack channel (e.g. a developers channel) and create an alarm in Cumulocity.

### Prerequisites

- Built.io credentials.
- Cumulocity credentials, i.e. a tenant, username and password.
- Slack channel to post messages to, [Slack app and OAuth token](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/getting-started).
- A Cumulocity microservice deployed and subscribed to the tenant.

Cumulocity microservices are server-side applications used to extend the platform with specific functionality. Developers are not restricted to any specific tech stack, however, there are certain requirements that must be met. Review the [Microservice SDK guide](https://cumulocity.com/guides/microservice-sdk/introduction/) for more details.

> **Note that trial accounts can be created for Built.io and Cumulocity.<br>Student accounts are also available.**

### Setup

On the Built.io dashboard, create a blank workflow and follow the steps below to configure it.<br>
Make sure to save the workflow when changes are made on the actions or parameters.

Initially, the workflow will contain the trigger (left side) and the completion (right side) actions.

#### 1. Define the environment parameters

Before adding actions to the workflow, the environment parameters shall be specified. Open the **Workflow settings** and add the following parameters (key/value pairs): username, password, server, microservice, trackerId. These parameters will be used to configure the different actions in the workflow.

#### 2. Check the /health endpoint

The first action to configure is to verify if a microservice is up and running. On the workflow dashboard's right side, search for the  **Node.js Code** action. It is not required to know JavaScript, but basic knowledge would be useful.

Drap the action to the dashboard and bind it to the
